# 5G_Anchor_Selection_Algorithm_NearestNeighbor

* In this ad-hoc case study, we studied the use of a couple of data-science methods to automate the process of selecting neighboring 4G LTE sites to be used as anchors for any given 5G NR node. The automation results were compared with actual field configurations to assess accuracy  

* The objective was mainly to improve and stream line the process of determining appropriate 5G anchors and also to help the regions with offloading some of the tedious manual work they were doing and also to reduce the overall number of missing anchors and maximize the usage of 5G NR technology
